#' spatialcompare: A package to construct spatially-sensitive tableaux of spatial features.
#'
#' The spatialcompare package provides two main functions:
#' normalizeAroundCentroid, and distribute.
#'
#' @section spatialcompare functions:
#' Constructing a spatialcompare graph requires two steps: 1. transforming the spatial features so
#' that they are centred around 0,0 of a notional or mock projection using metres;
#' 2. re-distributing features across the mock projection so that they can be plotted discretely
#' and compared visually.
