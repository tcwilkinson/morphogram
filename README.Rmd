# `spatialcompare`: Create comparative infographics using simple (spatial) features

This R-package is designed to facilitate the construction of infographics which place spatial features side-by-side, for example _to compare visually the dimensions of cities, study regions or building sizes in two dimensional space_. The package aims to preserve  the accurate or recognisable **shapes** (and by default, the **dimensions**) of the features to make them recognisable but transpose their spatial _position_ so that they are distributed visually. When spatial _dimensions_ are preserved, further spatial analysis (e.g. area calculations) or the additional of scale bars can be accurately plotted.

Functions rely on `sf` objects as inputs and outputs, hence the primary dependency of this package is `sf`. The use of `sf` objects provides maximum flexibility for ultimate graphics output; users can use base graphics or alternatives such as `ggplot` according to need or preference with the resulting reprojected and translated `sf` features.

Although theoretically any `sf`-compatible spatial features can be processed with this package, the most likely application is the orientation of polygons in a way that their relative size can be easily compared.

The original use-case was the visualization of the relative size of scientific study regions of different archaeological surveys and the relative size of ancient cities.

## Installation

This package relies on the `sf` package for calculating geometries and handling spatial data. Depending on the platform you are using, you may need to install GDAL and other dependencies before using `sf` and `spatialcompare`. Read the `sf` documentation for more information: [see sf README on GitHub](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/).

<!--
You cannot yet install the released version of spatialcompare from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("spatialcompare")
```
-->

You can install the current development version of `spatialcompare` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tcwilkinson/spatialcompare")
```

## Basic Example

- Aligning, distributing and plotting North Carolina districts as a grid

This example shows you how to align, distribute and then plot a set of simple (spatial) features using data distributed with the `sf` package:

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(spatialcompare)

# load polygon data from the sf package
nc <- sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"))
# align polygons around origin
nc_aligned <- align(nc,by.feature=T)
# distribute polygons into regular grid
nc_distributed <- distribute(nc_aligned, margin=1, x.mar=2)
# plot resulting distributed features
# optional: select first parameter, this is just for clarity of the final plot
nc_d <- nc_distributed[1] # AREA
plot(nc_d)
```
